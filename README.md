How It Works
  Grid Generation and Sudoku Validation

  The game generates a Sudoku puzzle and validates the entries in the following way:

  A grid of size 9x9 is created, initialized with empty cells.

  The grid is populated by recursively placing numbers that satisfy the Sudoku rules (no duplicates in rows, columns, or 3x3 subgrids).

  The puzzle is then randomized by removing a number of cells to create the question.
